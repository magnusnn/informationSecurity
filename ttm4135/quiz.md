##2

A message authentication code (MAC) is used to provide:
	
- message integrity;

An advantage of CTR mode over CBC mode for block ciphers is:
	
- CTR mode allows parallel encryption while CBC does not;

Padding may be required in CBC mode because:
	
- the plaintext may not fill an exact number of blocks;

ECB mode of operation is unsuitable for bulk encryption because
	
- it does not include any random or varying input

When a MAC tag is received, in order to check data integrity the recipient needs to:
	
- recompute the tag

A synchronous stream cipher
	
- requires the receiver to be synchronised (remain in step) with the sender throughout the decrypting process

In a binary synchronous stream cipher
	
- the keystreams generated by the sender and receiver are the same

The main disadvantage of the one time pad in practice is
	
- the key needs to be as long as the message making key management difficult

The A5/1 stream cipher, designed for GSM phones
	
- uses three LFSRs and combines their output

The RC4 cipher
	
- has known weaknesses and is widely deprecated for new systems

##3
The complexity of a problem:
	
- is no greater than the complexity of any algorithm which solves that problem;

In general it is possible to construct a public key encryption scheme from a trapdoor one-way function where:

- the trapdoor is the decryption key.

With regard to the Fermat test for testing whether a number n is prime:

- if the test outputs "composite" then n is definitely composite;

In the RSA cryptosystem the equation connecting the public exponent e and the private exponent d is:

- ed = 1 mod Î¦(n).

When generating the keys for RSA it is popular:

- to choose e=2^16+1;

OAEP is:

- a randomised padding scheme suitable for preparing messages prior to use of RSA;

The Chinese remainder theorem can be used with RSA to

- speed up decryption;

If n is a Carmichael number then:

- n is composite;

For numbers of a similar size, and for algorithms we currently know about:

- factorising numbers is harder than finding prime numbers;

For which of the following functions f(m) is it true that f(m) = O(m^2)

- f(m) = m;
- f(m) = 100m;
- f(m) = 100m^2 + 100m + 100;
- all of the above.

##quiz 4

Let g be a generator for the integers modulo p. The discrete logarithm problem is:

- given y, find x with y = g^x mod p;

With regard to the security of the Diffie-Hellman protocol we know that:

- an attacker who can find discrete logarithms can break the protocol.

A major limitation of the basic Diffie-Hellman protocol is:

- the messages are not authenticated;

In the Elgamal cryptosystem:

- the ciphertext is twice the size of the plaintext;

The best algorithm currently known to solve the elliptic curve discrete logarithm:

- is exponential in the length of the parameters.

A Diffie-Hellman key is ephemeral if:

- it is used in only one run of the protocol;

An elliptic curve point is:

- a pair of elements (x,y) in some field.

If full-scale quantum computers become available then:

	1 the RSA cryptosystem will be broken;
	
	2 the Diffie-Hellman protocol will be broken;
	
	3 the ElGamal encryption algorithm will be broken;
	
- all of the above.

For the same level of security we should choose:

	x  all of the above.

- the key size for RSA to be longer than the key size for elliptic curve based schemes;


One difference between ElGamal encryption and RSA encryption is that:

	x RSA provides randomised encryption without padding while ElGamal encryption does not; 

- the ElGamal encryption process requires two exponentiations while RSA encryption requires only one;
