##2

A message authentication code (MAC) is used to provide:
	
- message integrity;

An advantage of CTR mode over CBC mode for block ciphers is:
	
- CTR mode allows parallel encryption while CBC does not;

Padding may be required in CBC mode because:
	
- the plaintext may not fill an exact number of blocks;

ECB mode of operation is unsuitable for bulk encryption because
	
- it does not include any random or varying input

When a MAC tag is received, in order to check data integrity the recipient needs to:
	
- recompute the tag

A synchronous stream cipher
	
- requires the receiver to be synchronised (remain in step) with the sender throughout the decrypting process

In a binary synchronous stream cipher
	
- the keystreams generated by the sender and receiver are the same

The main disadvantage of the one time pad in practice is
	
- the key needs to be as long as the message making key management difficult

The A5/1 stream cipher, designed for GSM phones
	
- uses three LFSRs and combines their output

The RC4 cipher
	
- has known weaknesses and is widely deprecated for new systems

##3
The complexity of a problem:
	
- is no greater than the complexity of any algorithm which solves that problem;

In general it is possible to construct a public key encryption scheme from a trapdoor one-way function where:

- the trapdoor is the decryption key.

With regard to the Fermat test for testing whether a number n is prime:

- if the test outputs "composite" then n is definitely composite;

In the RSA cryptosystem the equation connecting the public exponent e and the private exponent d is:

- ed = 1 mod Î¦(n).

When generating the keys for RSA it is popular:

- to choose e=2^16+1;

OAEP is:

- a randomised padding scheme suitable for preparing messages prior to use of RSA;

The Chinese remainder theorem can be used with RSA to

- speed up decryption;

If n is a Carmichael number then:

- n is composite;

For numbers of a similar size, and for algorithms we currently know about:

- factorising numbers is harder than finding prime numbers;
